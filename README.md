# SQL Analysis of Banking Clients

📊 This SQL project analyzes the financial behavior of a bank's customers, using a relational database containing data about accounts, transactions, and card types.
## 📝 Description

The goal of the analysis is to derive, for each customer:

- Age
- Number of incoming and outgoing transactions
- Total amounts transacted
- Number of accounts and their types (Basic, Business, Private, Family)
- Types of transactions made (e.g., Salary, Amazon, Supermarket, etc.)
- Amount transacted by account type

All results are collected in a final table that aggregates the information customer by customer.

## 🛠️ Technologies used

- **SQL** (MySQL)
- Temporary tables (CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE)
- Joins, aggregations, CASE WHEN, COALESCE
- Functions such as TIMESTAMPDIFF and ROUND

## 📁 Included files

- `queries.sql` – Complete SQL script of the project, with comments in Italian.

## ℹ️ Notes

The project is written in Italian because the database is structured with table names, columns, and values in Italian. The project logic remains easily understandable even for those unfamiliar with the language.
